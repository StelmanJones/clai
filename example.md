Sure! Here is an example of a Markdown table:

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
| Cell 4   | Cell 5   | Cell 6   |

In this example, the table has three columns and six rows. Each cell in the
table is represented by a pair of double quotes, with the contents of the cell
inside the quotes. You can use Markdown to format the table in various ways,
such as:

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
| Cell 4   | Cell 5   | Cell 6   |

To create a table with a different number of columns or rows, simply add or
remove the `|` characters that separate the columns and rows. You can also use
Markdown to add additional formatting to your table, such as:

| Column 1 | Column 2                 | Column 3          |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Cell 1   | **Bold** Cell 2          | **Italic** Cell 3 |
| Cell 4   | **Strikethrough** Cell 5 | Cell 6            |

To make a cell bold, use double asterisks (`**`) around the cell contents. To
make a cell italic, use single asterisks (`*`) around the cell contents. To
strike through a cell, use tilde (`~`) characters around the cell contents. I
hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions..</s>‚èé
